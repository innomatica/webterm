# WebTerm Frontend

It is written in Svelte. The code heavily depends on [js-shell-emulator](`https://github.com/francoisburdy/js-shell-emulator).
Note that only minimal portion of [ANSI escape code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) is implemented at the moment.

To build it

```
npm install
npm run build
```
